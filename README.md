### Goal: 
##### Show the general structure someone can get to making this UI using web tools.

### Restrictions: 
##### I don't have the original assets and I myself don't know how to make these 3D models.

### Tools: 
##### Just used ThreeJS and Claude to make it quickly.

### Results: 
##### I made a general foundation that can show that using ThreeJS you can easily make the UI and Animations you need. If I had a 3D modeler I could likely recreate the entire original dashboard from xbox.
